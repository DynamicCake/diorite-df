# TODO

GET TO A RUNNABLE STATE
- Complete event declaration
- Panic when trying to use action args
- Don't do codegen
- This will might make a snap back to reality moment

Things I have to do and written down here so I do not forget
- Replace with struct deconstructor syntax
- Make sure to return the malformed recovery data structs

Things that might become hard
- Function declaration syntax
- Parameters
